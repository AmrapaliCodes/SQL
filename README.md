# SQL
Beginning with SQL
In this repo I will put down all my learnings and sample sql problems which will be helpful for me or anyone in advancing their skills in SQL

Day 1: We should use ANSI joins instead of using Non ANSI Joins in SQL due to these reasons:
  1. Queries will be shorter, cleaner and more easy to read, understand and debug
  2. Join condition and filter conditions are separated
  3. Avoids accidental cross join
